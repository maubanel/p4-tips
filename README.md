* Make sure you have P4V installed (this will automatically install P4)
* Make sure that in any directory you can run `p4 -V`. You should get a response.  On a mac make sure the "p4" executable is installed inside /usr/local/bin or even /usr/bin.
* Use a `.p4config` file. A [batch] file is available for you to use for Windows.
